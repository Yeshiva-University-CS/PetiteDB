package edu.yu.dbimpl.log;

/** Specifies the public API for the LogIterator implementation by requiring
 * all LogIterator implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * A class that provides the ability to move through the records of the log
 * file in reverse order.
 *
 * Design note: given that log iteration is done on startup by the recovery
 * manager as a single-threaded process, or on a per-tx basis for rollback, the
 * iterator need not be thread-safe.  If these assumptions are incorrect, then
 * the iterator must be thread-safe.
 * 
 * Note: "package private" by design since non-dbms-clients should not be
 * directly creating an instance.
