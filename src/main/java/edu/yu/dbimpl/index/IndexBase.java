/** Specifies the interface for all Index implementations.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this interface in any way.
 * 
 * An index is a file of index records such that an (index) record exists in
 * the index file for each record in the "real" table that's being indexed.
 * Each index record contains a RID (the record identifier of the "real record"
 * that's being indexed).  An index record also contains a "value": this is the
 * value of the field being indexed in the "real" record.
 *
 * The Index API resembles a customized TableScan in the sense that clients can
 * position the index at the beginning of the index file and iterate
 * sequentially through its records.  Unlike a TableScan, the client specifies
 * that she is only interested in index records whose "value" field matches a
 * specified "search key".  Iteration only proceeds through records whose
 * "value" field matches the "search key".  When positioned on an index record,
 * clients can read the index record's RID and pass that value to a Scan
 * instance on the "real" table to access the corresponding "real" record.
 * Clients can also use an Index to insert new index records or to delete index
 * reccords.
 * 
 * NOTE: this design precludes support of composite indices.
