/** Specifies the public API for the Buffer implementation by requiring all
 * Buffer implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * An single buffer in BufferMgr's buffer pool: it encapsulates a Page, adding
 * additional information such as whether the Page's contents have been
 * modified since it was fetched from disk.
 *
 * Design note: Buffers should be manipulated through the BufferMgr API to the
 * greatest extent possible.  For example, difficult to see how a client can
 * usefully create a Buffer through its constructor since it will not be
 * associated with a disk block.
