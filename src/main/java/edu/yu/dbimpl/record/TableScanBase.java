/** Specifies the public API for the TableScan implementation by requiring all
 * TableScan implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * A TableScan is an UpdateScan implementation over records stored in a file.
 *
 * Because the TableScan encapsulates (possibly many) blocks, it is responsible
 * for formatting any new blocks that it appends to the file.
 * 
 * Design note: given the PetiteDB assumptions about record layout (per lecture
 * discussion), there should be no need to persist the RID information.  Should
 * you choose to persist it, the implementation must not change the offset or
 * the block state (i.e., such meta-data must be persisted in a way that is
 * transparent to the client).
 *
 * Design note: a given instance of a TableScan need not be thread-safe.
