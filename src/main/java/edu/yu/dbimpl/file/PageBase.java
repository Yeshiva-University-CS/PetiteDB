/** Specifies the public API for the Page implementation by requiring all
 * Page implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * A Page represents the main-memory region used to hold the contents of a
 * block, and thus is used by the FileMgr in tandem with a BlockId.  A Page can
 * hold three value types: ints, strings, and "blobs" (i.e., arbitrary arrays
 * of bytes).  At the Page API abstraction, a client can store a value at any
 * offset of the page but is responsible for knowing what values have been
 * stored where.  The result of trying to retrieve a value from the wrong
 * offset is undefined.
 *
 * I prefer to not constrain implementation!  That said: your implementation
 * must follow the design for storing values of a given type (fixed-length
 * versus variable-length) as discussed in lecture and MUST BE FOLLOWED in your
 * implementation (see the Javadoc on maxLength() below).  Your implementation
 * MUST use exactly Integer.BYTES to store an int, Double.BYTES to store a
 * double, and 1 byte to store a boolean.

   * getter APIs.
