/** Specifies the public API for the Transaction implementation by requiring all
 * Transaction implementations to extend this base class.
 *
 * Students MAY NOT modify this class in any way, they must suppport EXACTLY
 * the constructor signatures specified in the base class (and NO OTHER
 * signatures).
 *
 * Transactions provide clients with the classic "ACID" properties, interfacing
 * with concurrency and recovery managers as necessary.
 *
 * Tx lifespan methods: the constructor begins a new transaction,
 * commit/rollback end that transaction.  "recover" rolls back ALL uncomitted
 * txs.
 *
 * Tx buffer management methods: all state written to, and read from, a buffer
 * is mediated through the appropriate setX/getX method.  All setX/getX methods
 * must acquire the appropriate locks before proceeding.  The method must throw
 * a LockAbortException if the DBMS is unable to acquire the lock within the
 * specified timeout period.  Before invoking these methods, clients must
 * invoke "pin" indicating that the tx should take control of the specified
 * block and the main-memory buffer that encapsulates that disk block.  The tx
 * maintains control until the client invokes "unpin".  The getX/setX methods
 * provide the hooks for Tx implementation to provide concurrency and recovery
 * function.
