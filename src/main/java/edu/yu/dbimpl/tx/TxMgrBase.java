 * A TxMgr is a factory for producing Transactions.
 *
 * The DBMS has exactly one TxMgr instance (singleton pattern), which is
 * created during system startup.
 *
 * Design note: it is recommended, but not required, for the TxMgr to delegate
 * all read/write function of its files to the lower-level "managers" supplied in the constructor.

   * On DBMS startup, the TxMgr is responsible for TRANSPARENTLY rolling back
   * transactions that (per log record state) were neither committed or rolled
   * back when the DBMS last closed down.  Per lecture and textbook, the
   * persisted state associated with such transactions must be rolled back to
   * their pre-tx state: i.e., no state modifications made by these txs may be
   * visible when the DBMS finished the recovery process and is "open for
   * business".
   *
   * If the TxMgr implementation is in ANY way dependent on knowledge of
   * whether or not the DBMS is in "startup" mode, it MUST access the
   * DBConfiguration singleton to determine if implementation specific actions
   * must be taken to (re)initialize the necessary state.
